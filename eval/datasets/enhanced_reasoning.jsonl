{"id": "bat_and_ball", "prompt": "A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? The ball costs $0.10.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "calculation", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "mathematics", "gold_confidence": 0.95, "explanation": "Incorrect calculation. If ball costs $0.10 and bat costs $1.00 more, then bat costs $1.10, making total $1.20, not $1.10. Correct answer: ball costs $0.05."}
{"id": "triangle_angles", "prompt": "In any triangle, the sum of the three interior angles is always 180 degrees. If two angles of a triangle are 60° and 70°, then the third angle must be 50°.", "gold_has_error": false, "error_type": "none", "difficulty": "easy", "domain": "geometry", "gold_confidence": 1.0, "explanation": "Correct application of triangle angle sum theorem: 60° + 70° + 50° = 180°."}
{"id": "prime_sum_always_even", "prompt": "The sum of any two prime numbers is always even because prime numbers are odd, and odd + odd = even.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "logical", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "number_theory", "gold_confidence": 0.9, "explanation": "False overgeneralization. 2 is prime and even, so 2 + 3 = 5 (odd). The claim fails for any prime pair including 2."}
{"id": "gravity_moon_correct", "prompt": "Gravity on the Moon is approximately 1/6th as strong as Earth's gravity because the Moon has less mass and smaller radius than Earth.", "gold_has_error": false, "error_type": "none", "difficulty": "easy", "domain": "physics", "gold_confidence": 0.95, "explanation": "Correct explanation of lunar gravity based on mass and distance relationships in Newton's law of gravitation."}
{"id": "water_boiling_misleading", "prompt": "Water always boils at exactly 100°C regardless of conditions because that's the definition of the Celsius scale.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "factual", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "chemistry", "gold_confidence": 0.85, "explanation": "Incorrect. Water's boiling point varies with pressure. 100°C is only at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). At higher altitudes, water boils at lower temperatures."}

Canberra is Australia's capital. Sydney is the largest city but not the capital."}
