{"id": "bat_and_ball", "prompt": "A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? The ball costs $0.10.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "calculation", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "mathematics", "gold_confidence": 0.95, "explanation": "Incorrect calculation. If ball costs $0.10 and bat costs $1.00 more, then bat costs $1.10, making total $1.20, not $1.10. Correct answer: ball costs $0.05."}
{"id": "triangle_angles", "prompt": "In any triangle, the sum of the three interior angles is always 180 degrees. If two angles of a triangle are 60° and 70°, then the third angle must be 50°.", "gold_has_error": false, "error_type": "none", "difficulty": "easy", "domain": "geometry", "gold_confidence": 1.0, "explanation": "Correct application of triangle angle sum theorem: 60° + 70° + 50° = 180°."}
{"id": "prime_sum_always_even", "prompt": "The sum of any two prime numbers is always even because prime numbers are odd, and odd + odd = even.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "logical", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "number_theory", "gold_confidence": 0.9, "explanation": "False overgeneralization. 2 is prime and even, so 2 + 3 = 5 (odd). The claim fails for any prime pair including 2."}
{"id": "gravity_moon_correct", "prompt": "Gravity on the Moon is approximately 1/6th as strong as Earth's gravity because the Moon has less mass and smaller radius than Earth.", "gold_has_error": false, "error_type": "none", "difficulty": "easy", "domain": "physics", "gold_confidence": 0.95, "explanation": "Correct explanation of lunar gravity based on mass and distance relationships in Newton's law of gravitation."}
{"id": "water_boiling_misleading", "prompt": "Water always boils at exactly 100°C regardless of conditions because that's the definition of the Celsius scale.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "factual", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "chemistry", "gold_confidence": 0.85, "explanation": "Incorrect. Water's boiling point varies with pressure. 100°C is only at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). At higher altitudes, water boils at lower temperatures."}

Canberra is Australia's capital. Sydney is the largest city but not the capital."}
{"id": "circular_reasoning_example", "prompt": "God exists because the Bible says so, and the Bible is true because it is the word of God. Therefore, God exists.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "logical", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "logic", "gold_confidence": 0.9, "explanation": "Classic circular reasoning fallacy. The conclusion (God exists) is used as a premise to support itself through the Bible's authority."}

Therefore, eating ice cream causes drowning.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "logical", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "statistics", "gold_confidence": 0.95, "explanation": "Fallacy of confusing correlation with causation. Both variables are caused by a third factor (hot weather/summer season), not each other."}

Therefore, vaccines are effective at preventing disease.", "gold_has_error": false, "error_type": "none", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "medicine", "gold_confidence": 0.9, "explanation": "Sound logical reasoning with valid premises leading to correct conclusion about vaccine efficacy."}
{"id": "appeal_to_authority", "prompt": "Climate change is real because 97% of climate scientists agree it's happening. Dr. Smith, a famous physicist, says it's not real. Since Dr. Smith is smarter, climate change is false.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "logical", "difficulty": "hard", "domain": "climate_science", "gold_confidence": 0.85, "explanation": "Misapplies appeal to authority.

Wait, that's wrong.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "logical", "difficulty": "hard", "domain": "mathematics", "gold_confidence": 0.8, "explanation": "Flawed mathematical induction. The inductive step is circular and contains basic arithmetic errors. The reasoning breaks down immediately."}
{"id": "slippery_slope_fallacy", "prompt": "If we allow students to retake exams, then they'll never study hard initially. This will make them lazy in college, then in their careers, ultimately destroying work ethic in society.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "logical", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "education", "gold_confidence": 0.8, "explanation": "Slippery slope fallacy. Makes extreme projections without evidence for each causal link in the chain."}

Since banning cars is impractical, we must accept environmental destruction.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "logical", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "environment", "gold_confidence": 0.9, "explanation": "False dichotomy fallacy. Presents only two extreme options while ignoring middle-ground solutions like electric cars, public transport, emissions standards, etc."}

This extreme position would destroy the economy.", "gold_has_error": true, "error_type": "logical", "difficulty": "medium", "domain": "environment", "gold_confidence": 0.85, "explanation": "Strawman fallacy. Misrepresents environmentalist position with extreme caricature, then attacks the distorted version rather than actual environmental arguments."}
{"id": "complex_physics_correct", "prompt": "Einstein's E=mc² shows mass-energy equivalence. In nuclear reactions, small amounts of mass convert to large amounts of energy because c² is huge.

Only hearing from successful entrepreneurs ignores the many who followed same advice but failed. Survivorship bias makes the advice seem more effective than it is."}
{"id": "anchoring_bias_math", "prompt": "Is the population of Turkey greater or less than 200 million?

Uses the arbitrary anchor (200M) to estimate rather than recalling actual facts. Turkey's population is actually around 84 million."}
